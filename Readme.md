# End-to-end AI Solution With PySpark & Real-time Data Processing With Apache NiFi

This project demostrates in a first phase, how to collect data in real-time via the [Conext Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/), transform it, and persist it using [DRACO](https://github.com/ging/fiware-draco) and in a second phase, how to run Apache Spark and Jupyter Notebooks on a Google Cloud [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) cluster.

# Used technologies  

- [Conext Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/): A FIWARE generic enbaler to manage context data in real time. 

- [DRACO](https://github.com/ging/fiware-draco): An easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. Internally, Draco is based on [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/docs.html), NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. It was built to automate the flow of data between systems.

- [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) : A managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning.

- [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/): An interface for Apache Spark in Python. It not only allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs, but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data in a distributed environment. PySpark supports most of Sparkâ€™s features such as Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, MLlib (Machine Learning) and Spark Core.

- [Spark MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html): Built on top of Spark, MLlib is a scalable machine learning library that provides a uniform set of high-level APIs that help users create and tune practical machine learning pipelines.

- [Jupyter Notbeook](https://jupyter.org/): An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
